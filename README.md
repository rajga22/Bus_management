This Java application called the Bus Management System was created to automate the management of bus fleets and passenger reservations. The system tackles typical operational issues by substituting automated methods for manual ones, improving bus management and ticketing operations' correctness and efficiency.

System Characteristics
Administrators can add buses with predetermined numbers and seating capacities using the "bus addition" feature.
Automated ticket booking ensures that riders are properly seated in buses that have seats available.
Bus Display: Promotes operational transparency by providing a list of all buses that are available and their state.
User Interface: Provides a menu-driven console interface that quickly and easily leads users through the different system capabilities.

Master.java is the driver code. 

Future Development:
Ticket Cancellation: Provide a feature that makes it possible to cancel already-made reservations.
Persistent Data preservation: To preserve data integrity and enable long-term preservation, put in place a database.
